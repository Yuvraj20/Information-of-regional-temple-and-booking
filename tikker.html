		<h2>TIKKER, Kupwara</h2>
		<br>
		<h6><small>Tikkar village is situated at a distance of 90km from Srinagar and Mata Kheer Bhawani Tikkar is situated at a distance of just 1.5 km from Kupwara and it just takes 1:45 hrs. to reach this place through every kind of fast transport available. Village Tikkar was used as base Camp by Sharda pilgrims who used to visit Sharda Mata (Now in Muzaffarabad in POK)  Mata Kheer Bhawani Temple. It falls on the right side of Kupwara Chowkibal road and is spread over 355 kanals of land donated by Kashmir Pandit Village Tikkar with large numbers and various kinds of popular trees, Kikar, Chinar, Nut,  Apple, Cheery and Deodar trees adding to the beauty of Mata Kheer Bhawani Asthapan Temple.
The temple  dedicated to Goddess  Kheer Bhawani (Ragnya Bagwati) is constructed over a sacred spring. Every year on Zestha Asthami Mela, thousands of pilgrims of all walks of life come and offer their prayers with devotion to get their wishes fulfilled by Mata Ragnya Bagwati. The worship of Mata Kheer Bhawani is universal among Hindus of Kashmir. The term Kheer refers to rice pudding that is offered to the spring to propitiate the Goddess which becomes part of the name of the temple. As is the custom with the Hindu deities, she has many names Maharagya Devi, Ragnya Devi, Rajni, Ragnya Bhagwati.
Sacred Spring
A unique septogonal spring dedicated to Goddess Kheer Bhawani flows with cosmic powers where Mata is omnipotent and omnipresent and blessing the devotees. The holy spring is known to change it colours with various hues of red, pink, orange, green, blue, white etc. A black shade of the water is believed to be inauspicious.
The devotees often chant this mantra in the morning prayers – “Namastee Sharda Devi Kashmir Purvasini Twaham Prartheye Nitam vidya Daanam Che De Hi Me”  meaning ” I owe my full gratitude to the great Goddess Sharda who lives in Kashmir. I request you to fill my mind with utmost power of concentration and studies”
Sharda Temple
A  Sharda Temple has been constructed at a hill top in the form of Shila (stone) covering the Amrit. It is believed that Sharda Bagwati came to Kashmir along with left over Amrit during Sumandar Manthan between Devtas and Demon and had a brief stay or rest at Manzgam, Tulmulla  and  in Tikkar and after that Mata Sharda took over the Amrit in a Kailash to its final destination at Sharda village (now in POK) in the form of Shilla (stone). There is a staircase from Mata Kheer Bhawani temple to Sharda temple of 100 steps.
Shree Bairv Nath Temple and Ganesh Temple
These two temples were constructed after migration by some devotees whose wishes were fulfilled by Mata Ragnya Bhagwati.
Ashrams of Great Saints
